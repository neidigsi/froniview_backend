# FroniView
FroniView is an OpenSource app that allows all owners of a "Fronius" inverter to view the energy generated by the solar system without having to go through a third-party server. <p>
With some small changes in the backend is an use of others firm's inverters possible! <p>
This backend provides the data uploaded by the system function of the inverter to the "FroniView" app.<p>

The API documentation is written in OpenAPI 3 and could be found in the folder "documentation".
